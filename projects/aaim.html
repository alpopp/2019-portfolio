<p>This was a complex, custom WordPress build. I did the development on this project and helped out with a few UX elements, including the filtering on the homepage and how the service icons got used throughout the site when the service was mentioned. </p>
<p>We used Advanced Custom Fields to extend the templates as well as the custom post types we created for this site. </p>
