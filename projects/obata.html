<p>As my last project for Obata, we finally got around to that rebuild for the portfolio site. This project went full Gutenberg, and boy was it a learning experience. I used ACF Blocks, but I think if I could do it over again I would have just built custom blocks using <code>create-guten-block</code>.</p>
<p>I have recently accepted a position with <a href="https://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a> as a Senior Web Developer in the Office of Public Affairs. There, I'll be helping create and manage many of their WordPress themes and plugins.</p>
