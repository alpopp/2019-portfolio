<p>Yes, I built my dog a website.</p>

<p>I've been looking for a reason to buy a .dog domain, and I wanted to play around with Jekyll and Github pages some more (which is the same setup as my portfolio site, actually). I bought this domain through Google Domains, I've been really happy with them so far.</p>

<p>What's cool about this quick build is that I got to make another <a href="https://twitter.com/harrythe_dog" target="_blank">twitter bot</a>! So far everything seems to be working fine. Every time I sync my changes to the github repository hosting this project, it sends the commit message as a tweet. This was an available integration through Zapier. </p>
