<p>This was another complex, custom WordPress build. This was my first attempt at implementinig a design system, which became crucial because of the modularity of the main template we created. </p>

<p>The site itself is pretty simple - it was just big and we needed to create something very easy for the client to keep up to date themselves. We decided to create a main template that had different areas where you could turn on or off different modules. These modules could be a slider, testimonials, call to actions, internal or external links, etc.. The design system made sure all modules stayed under one cohesive design, and the flexible template gave the client the ability to create their own unique pages. </p>

<p>We were also tasked with bringing in the sustainability report, which in the past was a seperate website. </p>
