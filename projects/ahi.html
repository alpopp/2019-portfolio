<p>I helped design this site with the team at Obata by researching and wireframing. Once the design was approved, I helped develop the site in WordPress as a custom theme using Gutenberg, Advanced Custom Fields, and a Mailchimp integration. </p>

<p>The most difficult part of this project was the two resources. Prototyping this out before the full design and build was crucial and helped make sure all parties and roles were on board with what the outcome was at every step. </p>

<p>If these resources are getting a lot of traffic in the future, we plan on expanding it by offering a shareable URL or a dynamic PDF that is downloadable. </p>
