            <p>Hello, my name is Alex! I'm a developer and UX designer in Saint Louis. I live in South City with my wife, <a href="http://www.alibrasselphotography.com/" target="_blank">Ali</a>, and our dog, <a href="https://harrythe.dog/" target="_blank">Harry</a>. When I'm not behind my desk, I'm probably hiking, <a href="https://untappd.com/user/apopp" target="_blank">enjoying a local brewery</a>, doing some below-average woodworking, or running! </p>
            
            <p>I currently serve as a senior web developer for Washington University in St. Louis. When I first started making websites, I had the opportunity to attend WordCamp St. Louis that was hosted on campus at WashU. I remember leaving the weekend having a tremendous ammount of respect for the work WashU does in WordPress, so to be able to work there now is really awesome and something I don't take for granted. </p>
